   CrewAI Local LLM is a GitHub repository designed to provide a locally hosted large language model (LLM) for private, offline usage. It allows users to experiment with AI models without the need for internet connectivity, ensuring data privacy and security. The repository includes comprehensive documentation and examples to help users set up and utilize the model effectively. Additionally, it supports a range of customization options to tailor the model's performance to specific needs and applications.
